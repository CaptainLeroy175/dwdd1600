        <h1>Who Were the Signers</h1>
        <h2>Famous Signers</h2>
        <p>Some of the most famous signers of the Declaration of Independence include:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Thomas Jefferson</dt>
            <dd>Principal author of the Declaration of Independence. He wrote the original draft of the document,
                which laid out the philosophical justifications for the colonies' decision to separate from Great
                Britain.</dd>

            <dt>John Adams</dt>
            <dd>Advocate for independence and a key figure in the Continental Congress. Adams played a crucial role
                in pushing for the declaration of independence and later served as the second President of the
                United States.</dd>

            <dt>Benjamin Franklin</dt>
            <dd>Diplomat and elder statesman. Franklin was instrumental in securing foreign support, particularly
                from France, for the American Revolution. He was also a key member of the Continental Congress.</dd>

            <dt>Samuel Adams</dt>
            <dd>Radical leader and organizer of resistance to British rule. He helped organize the Boston Tea Party
                and was a leading advocate for independence, helping to rally public sentiment in favor of the
                Revolution.</dd>

            <dt>John Hancock</dt>
            <dd>President of the Continental Congress. His bold and large signature on the Declaration became
                iconic, symbolizing defiance against British rule. Hancock is often remembered for his role in
                financing and supporting the revolution.</dd>

            <dt>Richard Henry Lee</dt>
            <dd>Introduced the motion for independence in Congress. Before the Declaration was signed, Lee's
                resolution in the Continental Congress called for the colonies to declare independence, setting the
                stage for the document's drafting.</dd>

            <dt>James Madison</dt>
            <dd>Future fourth President of the U.S. and “Father of the Constitution.” Though Madison wasn’t a direct
                signer (he was a bit younger), he was deeply involved in the political processes leading up to
                independence and was a key figure in drafting the Constitution.</dd>

            <dt>Thomas Paine</dt>
            <dd>Philosopher and writer. Paine’s pamphlet <em>Common Sense</em> was a powerful argument for
                independence that influenced public opinion, even though he wasn’t part of the Continental Congress.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>These individuals, along with the rest of the 56 signers, were key figures in the founding of the United
            States. Their decision to sign the Declaration was a bold act of defiance that set the stage for the
            American Revolution.</p>
